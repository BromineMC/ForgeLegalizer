## Reporting Security Issues

If you believe that the bug you've found may be used to attack clients or servers using ForgeLegalizer, please do NOT
use public GitHub Issues tracker and report it using via the "Security" tab. (more information can be found in the
[GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability))

As this project is maintained by individual contributors, we ask you to
give us 90 days of remediation before we can publicly disclose the issue.
